{:.introduction}
Management support is vital to ensure that resources are available and accessibility is prioritized.

Use your prepared business case to secure commitment to project goals, ideally by more senior management. This will simplify many issues down the line, especially when there are clashes in project or organizational priorities. Where you have limited influence within your organization, this backing will be invaluable.

Persuade other project teams with a stake or role in your organization's online presence of the value of accessibility. Individuals in these teams may also be able to take on some accessibility responsibility or be helpful in adding additional influence for the project goals.
