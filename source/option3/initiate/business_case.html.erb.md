{:.introduction}
A business case will help communicate why accessibility is important and program goals. This can help in both securing management support and raising organizational awareness.

Management support will help with securing budget for accessibility activities, and with prioritizing accessibility with regard to other project or program goals. A business case aims to help communicate the value of accessibility and develop an understanding of the extent of the work involved.

Understanding why accessibility has become important will help in the preparation of persuasive materials that respond to business objectives. Key reasons may also suggest additional necessary activities to explore in a business case. For example, an executive directive to increase revenue by growing the website's reach to include people with disabilities, older people, and mobile web users will likely require more robust reporting of accessibility achievements and impact on revenue.
