{:.introduction}
Spreading the word within an organization can help ensure accessibility is not forgotten and that workload is shared.

Communication can help to raise awareness of the importance and value of accessibility to your organization. Many may not appreciate that their role has an impact on the accessibility of online organizational resources and services. Others may not appreciate the value that incorporating accessibility into the organization brings.

Prepare resources to provide an introduction to accessibility generally, and organizational goals and activities more specifically. Presented to key staff or departments, this will help improve support for activities.

Ensure that projects and programs are made aware of who holds responsibility for accessibility. The aim is to intercept problems as early as possible, and make sure that solutions are identified as early as possible.
