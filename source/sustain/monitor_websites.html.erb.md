{:.introduction}
As your website content changes, ensure that regular accessibility reviews are performed. Include accessibility checks within the publishing process to help reduce the risk of issues occurring.

Provide a consistent evaluation process and reporting template. This will help comparison of findings to identify trends across websites or teams and help in management reporting activities.

Reviews should seek to identify issues and also identify why those issues are occurring. Some questions to consider:

* Are issues caused by one member of staff who has not had any training?
* Are they as a result of a change in the content management system?
* Is the publishing process is unclear in some areas?

Take action to correct the issues and also to remedy the reason for the issues occurring.
