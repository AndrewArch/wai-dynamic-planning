{:.introduction}
Consider what technologies you aim to support and ensure that you track functionality that changes each version. This will include what baseline browsers and assistive technologies you support and also the authoring tools that you use, such as your content management system.

### Baseline support list

Update the list of browsers and assistive technologies that are supported for website development. New versions will bring new features and improved support for existing standards. Consider what additional accessibility support new versions will bring and determine what additional work might be needed to take advantage of them. Any work can then be fed into the next iteration of the site.

Similarly, new versions of your authoring tools may provide additional accessibility features that you can take advantage of. You may need to update training or provide extra training to ensure that content authors are able to use the features following systems upgrades. There may also be value in feeding back to authoring tool vendors suggested improvements that will help you to deliver accessibility.

### Hardware

Upgraded and new hardware are generally less frequent than software changes, but should also be considered. This includes new consumer devices intended to access the Web, but also includes new assistive technologies. Explore new technology as it becomes commonly available and consider what changes might be necessary to support accessibility. For assistive technologies, consider working with advocacy organisations to identify new technologies and what changes may be necessary to support them.
