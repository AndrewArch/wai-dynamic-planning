{:.introduction}
Having successfully delivered your website, ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to user accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support and also clear escalation paths for issues that cannot be resolved immediately. Inform the user who raised the issue of any escalation that requires more involved changes and when improvements might be expected.

General improves to your website can be communicated via your public Accessibility Statement. Use this to indicate recent improvements as well as what you are seeking to achieve. You might also use your accessibility statement to reach out to audiences and seek feedback that can be used to inform future improvements.
