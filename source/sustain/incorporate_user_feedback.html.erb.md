{:.introduction}
Ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to user accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support and also clear escalation paths for issues that cannot be resolved immediately. Inform the user who raised the issue of any escalation that requires more involved changes and when improvements might be expected.

Communicate accessibility improvements on your website in the Accessibility Statement. Provide mechanisms to gather feedback to be used to inform future improvements.
