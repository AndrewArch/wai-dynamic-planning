{:.introduction}
Perform a detailed accessibility review of websites in scope of your objectives. This can create a baseline for future work, identify where training or additional expertise is needed, and help clarify how big a problem exists. The review may highlight instances of good practice, which indicates staff or suppliers who have critical skills to build on.

Review results are helpful to identify problems to be avoided in future work, even if the project involves completely replacing an existing website. Review results are also helpful in stakeholder reporting activities. Highlight existing problems and their impact so that later in the project the impact of positive change can be put into context.

Expert assistance may be required if your available resources do not have the skills and experience needed to undertake a thorough review.
