{:.introduction}
Perform a detailed accessibility review of any existing websites. This can create a baseline for future work, identify where training or additional expertise is needed, and help clarify how big a problem exists. The review may highlight instances of good practice, this may identify staff or suppliers who know what they are doing.

Focus on current project goals rather than seeking to review every website. This helps control scope and focus attention. If the project involves completely replacing an existing website, a review will identify problems to be avoided in future work. In this case the results serve as a valuable learning opportunity.

Review results will also be helpful in stakeholder reporting activities. Highlight existing problems and their impact so that later in the project the impact of positive change can be put into context.

Expert assistance may be required if your available resources do not have the skills and experience needed to undertake a thorough review.
