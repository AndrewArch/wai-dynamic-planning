{:.introduction}
Your budget needs will obviously depend on your accessibility goals and you may need experienced staff to aid in estimating the extent of the work required to achieve them. Some things that need to be considered when creating a budget are:

* Accessibility evaluations - consider how frequently they need to occur and how extensive they need to be
* Reviews of policies and procedures - time required to determine which policies need to be change, time required to make the change, and time required to implement the changes
* Staff training - general awareness raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as software development or content writing
* Experienced support - additional external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improve

Once the budget is determined, you will need to ensure that you have sufficient approval. This may require having clearly identified metrics to determine the return on the investment. These should cover topics such as CSR, improved sales, improved dissemination of message, etc. These may already be touched on or specified in the business case.
