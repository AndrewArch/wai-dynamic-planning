{:.introduction}
Your budget needs depend on your accessibility goals and you may need aid in estimating the extent of the work required to achieve them. Some things that need to be considered when creating a budget are:

* Accessibility evaluations - consider how frequently they need to occur and how extensive they need to be.
* Reviews of policies and procedures - time required to determine which policies need to be change, time required to make the change, and time required to implement the changes.
* Staff training - general awareness raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as software development or content writing.
* Experienced support - additional external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improves.

Once the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval. Your business case helps to secure budget, and you should ensure that the presentation of budget is supported by estimations on how changes might impact on KPIs and what return on investment could be expected. This might include better website performance, reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved visitor statistics, or improved corporate social responsibility.
