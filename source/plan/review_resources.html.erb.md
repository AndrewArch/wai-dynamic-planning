{:.introduction}
Reviewing (and fixing) the environment in which websites are created can help prevent many accessibility issues from occurring. Some resources/tools/things will have a direct impact on end product accessibility, such as content management systems (CMS), whereas others have more of an indirect impact, for example, staff recruitment policy. You will not likely be able to review and fix all areas so try to prioritize based on impact, cost to implement changes, and immediacy @@TODO what do I mean by immediacy - how quick it is to make the change? how quick the change will make a difference? or how important it is to have the change in quickly?@@.

Content management systems (CMS) and templates have a fundamental impact on accessibility and are difficult to change later on. Review how well your authoring tools support accessibility. Consider how the tools help create accessible content and also how they support content editors with disabilities.  Also consider processes involved in the production of online content for your website, such as, editorial processes or video creation. @@TODO Need to say more about what to consider?@@

Review shared resources used in website production, such as design guidelines or coding libraries. Improvements to these resources can have a big impact on website accessibility throughout your organization.

Shared website resources are a good way to get a big change - review and plan to fix
Assess existing skills and experience - needed be arduous, can be self-stated
Explore general attitudes and culture - although much of that will be apparent from earlier work

Don't forget to consider how current staff understand and view accessibility. This will help determine what training will be required but also help you plan any communications activities. Self-reporting is likely to be sufficient to determine accessibility skills. Attitude and awareness is something that can be continually explored @@HOW?? and WHY??@@
