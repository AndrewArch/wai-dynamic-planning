{:.introduction}
The environment in which your websites are created and maintained have equally significant impact on their accessibility. Also review these surrounding aspects, including:

* How well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining accessible content; for example, does the content management system (CMS) support your accessibility commitments?
* What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the staff creating and maintaining your websites? How well is training support provided to improve the situation?
* Are there design and development guidelines, shared templates and coding libraries, common authoring practices, and other centralized resources that can be improved for accessibility?
* How well do the existing policies and processes support your undertaking; for example, are there procurement policies to ensure purchasing of accessible tools and content?

Having clear understanding of the issues will help you better address them. For example, you may identify that without improving the content management system (CMS) or without training, there is no way to achieve your accessibility objectives.
