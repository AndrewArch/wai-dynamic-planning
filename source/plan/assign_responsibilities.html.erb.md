{:.introduction}
Responsibility for delivering accessibility needs to be assigned to specific individuals and incorporated into their job description. Formalising the responsibility helps ensure that the individual has time for the work and can receive training. Clear identification also helps communicate who is responsible for accessibility and that it is being prioritized.

Responsibilities can be spread throughout your organization, which increases awareness and reduces the risk of the activities overwhelming an individual or team. Some example responsibilities include;

* Marketing - Embed accessibility within brand or design guidelines.
* Quality assurance - Test for and track accessibility issues within the code.
* Development - Maintain code libraries with accessible components.
* Purchasing - Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes.
* Acceptance testing - Ensure that any agency-delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility.
* Recruitment - Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles.
