{:.introduction}
Engage with your stakeholders to get them on board and to identify what they can deliver and how they can help you. This includes internal stakeholders such as project teams, marketing, and management, as well as external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example:

* Coordinate with project teams on relaunch and development cycles;
* Introduce accessibility aspects in marketing campaigns;
* Keep management up-to-date on your planning and implementation;
* Negotiate with suppliers to better support you with accessibility;
* Find out the latest accessibility trends for advocates and champions;
* Provide feedback channels to engage with your customers and end-users.

Particularly the latter aspect can help you communicate your efforts publicly, set expectations, and increase committment for accessibility. For example, a public accessibility statement that identifies aspects of your websites that work well and less well, explanation of the plans to improve inaccessibility, and contact information in case customers observe barriers can help you overcome the transition period and gather feedback to prioritize repairs.
