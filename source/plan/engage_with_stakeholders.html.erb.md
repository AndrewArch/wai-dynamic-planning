{:.introduction}
Engage with your stakeholders to bring them on board and to identify how they can help you meet your accessibility goals. This includes internal stakeholders such as project teams, marketing, and management, as well as external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example:

* Introduce accessibility aspects in marketing campaigns.
* Report progress to management.
* Negotiate with suppliers to better support you with accessibility.
* Find out the latest accessibility trends for advocates and champions.
* Provide feedback channels to engage with your customers and end-users.

Communicate your efforts publicly to help set expectations and increase internal committment for accessibility. A public accessibility statement that identifies parts of your websites that work well and less well, explains accessibility improvements to come, and provides contact options for customers to report problems can help you overcome the transition period and gather feedback to prioritize repairs.
