{:.introduction}
Stakeholders may include management, other internal teams, such as marketing, suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. All stakeholders have an interest in accessibility activities, either because they need to respond to goals, such as development teams, or because they benefit in some way, such as advocacy groups.

Provide accurate and up-to-date information to stakeholders so that they are better able to help meet the accessibility goals. Consider how the stakeholder group can contribute to the improvement of accessibility. For example, many advocacy groups and charities provide training services.

Consider what opportunities exist to help communicate accessibility goals and activities with internal stakeholders. For example, formal management meetings provide an opportunity to report on progress against key performance indicators. Informal meetings can provide an opportunity to exchange information and explore ideas.

Your accessibility statement, a public version of your accessibility policy, provides a useful point of contact for external stakeholders and an opportunity to highlight accessibility achievements. You also need to ensure that there are feedback channels in place for all your stakeholders.
