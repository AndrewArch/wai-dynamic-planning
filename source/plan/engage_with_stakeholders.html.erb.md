{:.introduction}
Stakeholders may include management, other internal teams, such as marketing, suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. All stakeholders will have an interest in accessibility activities, either because they will need to respond to changes or because they will benefit in some way. Providing accurate and up-to-date information to these groups will put them in a better position to help you. Also consider how the stakeholder group can contribute to the improvement of accessibility. For example, many advocacy groups and charities provide training services.

Regardless of who you are engaging with there are a number of activities that will be important. Your accessibility statement, a public version of your accessibility policy, provides a useful point of contact for external stakeholders and an opportunity to highlight accessibility achievements. You will also need to ensure that there are feedback channels in place for all your stakeholders.
