{:.introduction}
Having defined goals it is important to ensure that the progress towards those goals can be easily determined. For each goal you will need to determine how you will know when it has been met or what progress has occurred. These key perfomance indicators (KPI) will vary ... You will also need to ensure that there are clear stakeholder feedback points identified.

Some example KPIs include,

* Number WCAG 2.0 Level A Success Criteria passed
* Monthly sales
* Number of complaints received related to accessibility
* Calls handled from people who were unable to process their application online
* Positive social media comments on accessibility of service
* Training sessions delivered

For an organization-wide framework, it is valuable to develop a standard report structure to capture the measure of accessibility for websites or tools. This will help in determining progress, generally and for individual websites, and in identifying areas where more resources are required to meet the organizational standards.

For long-term or ongoing goals you will need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. For example, updates to content and website maintenance work may introduce new accessibility barriers or new staff may not have the necessary skills. Plan for regular reviews of random sample content from the website. Ensure that clear responsibility is assigned for the checks and there are clear escalation paths for identified issues.

For project related monitoring, ensure that milestones are set throughout to assess project deliverables against organizational goals. Accessibility checks can be performed at all stages of a project, not only when the website is completed. For example, color choices can be checked on mocked-up website designs. By starting early and checking throughout the project you reduce the risk of being constrained by early design decisions that become expensive to change later in the project.
