{:.introduction}
An organizational policy on web accessibility captures your goals and targets regarding the development and maintenance of accessible web content and services. Policies will vary greatly but as a minimum would indicate what web accessibility means to your organization. For example, a policy might simply state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.0 Level AA. A more involved policy might cover topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, or reporting.

Review any existing policies and commitments relating to accessibility. For example, there may be policies relating to work ethics, equal opportunities, diversity, or corporate social responsibility (CSR) that could be relevant. Reviewing existing policies will also provide more insight on the organizational understanding and view of accessibility.

Your policy will need approval and backing from management. This ensures that resources needed to meet accessibility commitments can be justified and and prioritized. With backing there is also more opportunity to integrate accessibility goals into other policies that impact on the ability to deliver against commitments, such as recruitment or procurement.
