{:.introduction}
An organizational policy on web accessibility captures your goals and targets for web accessibility. Policies will vary across organizations but as a minimum would indicate what web accessibility standard you aim to conform with and by when. For example, a policy might simply state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.0 Level AA within one year. Other aspects will cover topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting.

{::nomarkdown}<%= link_to "Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility", (w3url '/WAI/impl/pol') %>{:/} provides information on what needs to be considered when creating your policy.

Your policy will need approval and backing from management. This ensures that resources needed to meet accessibility commitments can be justified and and prioritized. With backing there is also more opportunity to integrate accessibility goals into other policies that impact on the ability to deliver against commitments, such as recruitment or procurement.
