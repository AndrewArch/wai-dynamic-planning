{:.introduction}
An organizational policy on web accessibility captures your goals and targets for web accessibility. Policies vary across organizations but as a minimum would indicate what web accessibility standard you aim to conform with and by when. For example, a policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.0 Level AA within one year. Other aspects may cover topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting.

Ensure the policy has approval and backing from management. Backing will halp all implementation activities, ensuring that resources are available and activities are prioritized.
