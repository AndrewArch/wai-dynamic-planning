{:.introduction}
One of the first questions from stakeholders or management is likely to be 'How much of a problem do we have?'. Part of the answer to this question is concerned with knowing what issues currently exist with organizational or project web resources. This can be assessed by performing accessibility audits on key websites.

Assessing everything in your organization may be a daunting task. Avoid this causing inertia by setting a manageable scope that includes key organizational resources, such as the main website. This will provide a rough indication of the scale of any problem, and because these are the key resources, results will help focus attention. 

Creating such a baseline will help in the short-term with securing backing and support, setting goals, and developing policies. In the long-term, a baseline will allow you to measure the impact of any accessibility improvements.
