{:.introduction}
Understand why accessibility has become important to the organization and create a business case that responds to those reasons. The business case should also communicate the added value of accessibility.

The business case aims to persuade organizational stakeholders and senior management that accessibility should be prioritized within web projects. It will need to explore the reasons for accessibility, the risks associated with the issue, and what changes or resources are needed to address it. The business case may also need to outline what measures will be used to track improvements in accessibility and the broader return on investment.
