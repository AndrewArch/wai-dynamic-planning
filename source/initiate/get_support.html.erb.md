{:.introduction}
Key stakeholder or management support will simplify the process of introducing or improving accessibility. Management support will help with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communications activities. The business case will help convince management, although ensuring that a rationale that supports key business objectives will provide additional incentive.

Stakeholders may also include project teams involved in other aspects of the organization's online presence. Persuading these groups on the benefits of incorporating accessibility into deliverables will help increase the drive for accessibility and create more advocates or champions.
