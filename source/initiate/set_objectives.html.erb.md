{:.introduction}
Create objectives in response to identified accessibility problems and organizational goals. Develop measurable objectives that address accessibility gaps within the organization's web content, processes, and policies. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that successful delivery can be determined.

Ensure that objectives have management agreement and support. This will help secure funding, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. 

The best outcomes for accessibility come when objectives are aligned and integrated with the broader project. So consider objectives that integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes.

Examples of objectives might include:

* Develop accessibility policy by year-end.
* Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new Web procurement activities by year-end.
* Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA non-conformancies within 18 months.
* Prepare and deliver accessible writing course for all content authors by May.
* Modify design approval process to include accessibility considerations before June.
