{:.introduction}
Identify and set measurable objectives that respond to identified accessibility problems. Objectives will help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define what deliverables are required and when, and ensure that successful delivery is easily determined.

Ensure that objectives have management support and agreement. This will help secure funding, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your mandate. 

Examples objectives might include:

* Develop accessibility policy by year-end;
* Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new Web procurement activities by year-end;
* Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA barriers within 18 months;
* Prepare and deliver accessible writing course for all content authors by May.
