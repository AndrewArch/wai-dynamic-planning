{:.introduction}
The more you understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your organization. If you want to deepen your own understanding of web accessibility issues in order to be a more effective advocate, here are some suggested supporting activities: 
 
*	Introductory articles and videos;
*	Asking colleagues, friends, and family members with disabilities;
*	Training appropriate for your particular role;
* Disability organizations offering training or information services.

First-hand experience of how people with disabilities use the web can be enlightening and inspiring. This can help convince others of the need for web accessibility. 

### What is accessibility?

Web content and services are accessible when they are equally available to all people regardless of disability. Web accessibility brings much broader benefits both to your organization and other website visitors. For example, visitors using mobile devices with smaller screens and older people with changing abilities due to aging benefit from accessible websites.
