{:.introduction}
The better you understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your organization. If you want to deepen your own understanding of web accessibility issues in order to be a more effective advocate, here are some suggestions: 
 
*	Research introductory articles and videos;
*	Talk with colleagues, friends, and family members with disabilities;
*	Find training appropriate for your particular role;
* Seek information or training from accessibility and disability organizations;
* Set up assistive technology demonstrations.

First-hand experience of how people with disabilities access web content can be enlightening and inspiring. This can help others understand the benefits and value of accessibility. 

### What is web accessibility?

Web accessibility fulfills the basic promise of the web - making information and communication readily available to all people regardless of barriers in geography, language, or disability. Integrating accessibility into websites brings broader benefits to organizations and other website visitors. For example, easier code maintenance and better user experiences, particularly on mobile devices.
