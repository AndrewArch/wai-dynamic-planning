{:.introduction}
An effective business case demonstrates why and how web accessibility aligns and integrates into organizational strategies and goals. This perspective is needed by stakeholders and management so they can agree to provide financial support and business priority for accessibility.

Depending on organizational priorities, the business case should explore:

* Direct impact for users with disabilities
* Broader benefits for everyone, such as usability
* Financial, time, and resource costs associated with not addressing accessibility early
* Legal aspects that may be applicable to your organization
* Impact on corporate social responsibility

The business case should also outline the risks associated with ignoring accessibility, provide some indication of the resources needed, and specify how improvements will be tracked, and anticipated return on investment.
