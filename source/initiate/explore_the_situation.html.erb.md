{:.introduction}
Explore and learn the current state of accessibility in your organization to help when initiating discussions with stakeholders and management. Several aspects of web accessibility can be checked fairly easily, with little or no technical skills required. This includes cursory checks of:

* Key websites and website user activities
* Web content policies and processes, such as those related to editing and publishing
* General awareness of and attitude towards accessibility and disability
* Understanding of accessibility law and policy as they effect your organization

You may not be in the position to explore all these aspects in a first attempt. However, the more information you can gather, the better you will understand the types and sources of the issues that need to be addressed.
