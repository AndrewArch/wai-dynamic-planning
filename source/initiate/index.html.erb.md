## Initiate

Starting any program of work involves developing clear goals and solid management support, both administratively and financially. Like quality, accessibility is more a feature of web deliverables than a deliverable in itself. This means that the environment in which projects are developed needs careful thought to ensure that accessibility is well-supported.
