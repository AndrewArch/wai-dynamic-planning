{:.introduction}
Raise awareness by communicating the importance and value of accessibility to the organization. Many people may not appreciate that their role has an impact on website accessibility. Others may not appreciate the additional value that accessibility brings.

Prepare resources to provide a general introduction to accessibility including how the organization aims to improve accessibility. Help improve support for activities by making key project staff aware of the need and goals.

Project and programme teams should be made aware of who is responsible for accessibility. This ensures that issues are identified early and managed correctly.
