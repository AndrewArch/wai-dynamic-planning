{:.introduction}
Define project accessibility goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-targeted. This helps to focus your team, clarifies what activities need to be planned, defines what deliverables are required and when, and ensures that successful delivery is easily determined.

Goals may address the accessibility of a single website, or may be more related to broader integration of accessibility into development processes and policies.

Examples goals might include:

* Develop accessibility policy by year-end.
* Include and enforce accessibility targets for all new web procurement activities.
* Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA barriers within 18 months.
* Prepare accessibility awareness and accessible writing course for all content authors.
