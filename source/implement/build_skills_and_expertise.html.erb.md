Continually develop the accessibility skills of the staff, including designers, developers, and content creators. This includes providing training for existing, as well as including accessibility skills in staff recruitment criteria. Examples of training could include:

* Introductions to accessibility - Generally valuable for everyone
* How accessibility benefits your business - Management and project managers
* Accessible visual design - Designers and marketing
* Accessible implementation - Developers and testers
* Writing accessible content - Non-technical content authors

[http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/ Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training] provides guidance on creating training curricula customized to your particular needs.

Document and share experience from projects to build knowledge and benefit from ongoing improvements in how to create accessible websites. Consider how to capture and communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques. Include what didn't work as well as what did to avoid time being spent on approaches known to have problems.
