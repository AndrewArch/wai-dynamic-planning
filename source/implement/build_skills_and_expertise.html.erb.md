{:.introduction}
Develop the accessibility skills of your staff, including designers, developers, and content creators. This includes providing training for existing staff, as well as including accessibility skills in staff recruitment criteria. Examples of training include:

* **Introductions to accessibility** for everyone
* **How accessibility benefits your business** for management and project managers
* **Accessible visual design** for designers and marketing
* **Accessible coding solutions** for developers and testers
* **Writing accessible content** for non-technical content authors

Document and share experience from projects to build knowledge and benefit from ongoing improvements in creating accessible websites. Consider how to capture and communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques. Include what didn't work as well as what did to avoid time being spent on approaches known to have problems.
