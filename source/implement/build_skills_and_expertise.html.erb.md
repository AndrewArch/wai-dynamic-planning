{:.introduction}
Develop the skills of the team of designers, developers, and content creators responsible for project delivery. All team members and other project managers will benefit from a general introduction to accessibility course. This will help raise awareness of the issue and help understanding how people with disabilities use the web. Use the information obtained when reviewing staff awareness and knowledge to create training that meets their needs.

Example training sessions and who might benefit most:

* Introduction to accessibility - Generally valuable to help build understanding
* How accessibility benefits your business - Management and project managers
* Accessible visual design - Designers and marketing
* Accessible rich internat applications - Developers
* Writing accessible content - Content authors

Integrate any training into staff induction courses. This helps to build awareness and expertise but also highlights how important accessibility is to your organization.

Change recruitment briefs to include accessibility skills as an essential element of candidate experience. Once recruited, new experience staff can help boost team skills by sharing their experience and knowledge.

Share experience from past projects to build knowledge and benefit from ongoing improvements in how to create accessible websites. This helps to ensure that good practice is available for each new project and improve productivity. Consider how to capture and communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques. Include what didn't work as well as what did to avoid time being spent on approaches known to have problems.
