{:.introduction}
Integrate the goals from your Accessibility Policy within other organizational procedures and policies. This will help spread the responsibility but also ensure that accessibility is considered as an integral part of day-to-day activities.

The following are some examples of where incorporating accessibility can bring broad benefits.

* Recruitment policies
  
  Change general recruitment briefs or policies to ensure that accessibility is an required skill for new recruits. The required knowledge will vary depending on the role, for example developers will need skill in creating accessible code, project managers will need knowledge of integrating accessibility into project plans.
  
* Document publication process

  Incorporate accessibility checks as part of your web content publishing workflow. This ensures that good practice is maintained and that final web content continues to be accessible. Checks will also help identify where additional training may be required.

* Procurement process

  Ensure that suppliers are aware of your accessibility requirements by including criteria in any request for quotations. Including accessibility as an element of the supplier selection process will also help ensure that third-party deliverables meet your accessibility policy. Consider including successful completion of an independent accessibility evaluation as a requirement of final user acceptance testing.
