Planning will clarify what areas of work need to be addressed, such as updating policies and processes, improving authoring tools, fix issues. Distribute these tasks throughout the team and ensure that you monitor and track progress. Look for opportunities to optimize delivery of improvements. For example, shared training sessions between departments, or ensuring all websites use the same accessible content management system.
