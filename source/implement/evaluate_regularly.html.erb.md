{:.introduction}
Evaluate accessibility throughout the design and development process, and particularly at key milestones and sprints. Evaluate key web pages, processes, and stand alone components as they become available.

Early evaluations of designs help identify problems and potential problems before significant coding work takes place. Other design resources, such as personas, and user stories, can also be reviewed to include accessibility considerations. This will help designers better understand how people with disabilitieis interact with your website. 

Include input from users with disabilities as part of your evaluations. Encourage team members to attend testing sessions as this provides insight and context into barriers and helps team members identify with the problems caused.

Use a standard report structure to capture evaluation findings. This allows for comparisons between different websites and across versions of the same website. Raise accessibility issues in any issue tracking system to ensure that it is allocated resources and fixed as part of the standard quality assurance cycle.
