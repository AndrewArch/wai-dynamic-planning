{:.introduction}
While all set accessibility targets will need to be met, prioritizing can help you achieve them more effectively. Examples of prioritization include:

* Start with issues that are easier to address, to help build motivation in the team and demonstrate success.
* Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to support the creating of accessible content.
* Prioritize visual design aspect, to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization.
* Prioritize recruitment or procurement policies to address anticipated hiring and acquisitions.
* De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, such as a content management system (CMS), that are expected to be changed soon anyway.

Involve different perspectives, including internal and external stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation regularly to benefit from arising opportunities.
