{:.introduction}
While all set accessibility targets will need to be met, prioritizing can help you achieve them more effectively. Examples of prioritization include:

* Starting with issues that are easier to address, to help build motivation in the team and demonstrate success.
* Prioritizing the development of accessible templates and components to support the creating of accessible content.
* Prioritizing visual design aspect, to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization.
* Prioritizing recruitment or procurement policies to address anticipated hiring and acquisitions.
* De-prioritizing issues that are related to a product, such as a content management system (CMS), forms generator, or programming framework, that is expected to be changed soon anyway.

Further prioritization criteria are described in [http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/improving#prioritize Prioritize Solutions section of Improving the Accessibility of Your Website].

Involve different perspectives, including internal and external stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation regularly to benefit from arising opportunities.
