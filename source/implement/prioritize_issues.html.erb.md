{:.introduction}
Project deadlines may require you to prioritize resources to ensure that key functionality is accessible or key goals are met. For identified issues consider:

* What is the impact on people with disabilities?

  The WCAG Success Criteria Level indicates the generalized impact, but the actal impact depends on the context of the issue and the target audience. For example, a 'buy' image button with no alternative text will prevent some users from purchasing from your website. However, a minor image in the footer with no alternative text will have less impact. User experience testing and reporting is an important measure of the impact of accessibility issues.

* What is the effort required for repair?

  The time, cost, and skills required to fix an issue will vary greatly. For example, repairing an issue in the header could require a simple change to a template that is automatically propagated throughout the website, or it could require changing every page manually.

  Discussion with representatives from all teams can help you quickly determine possible solutions and what effort would be required to implement them. Ensure that whoever is responsible for implementing the solution is involved, as they will know best what constraints exist.
  
Seek to address high impact, low effort issues first. This approach usually takes less time overall and completes lots of changes quickly. This also helps demonstrate your commitment to the accessibility of your websites.
