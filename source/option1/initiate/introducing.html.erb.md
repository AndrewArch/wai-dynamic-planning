{:.introduction}
For those new to accessibility, find out what it is and why it is important.

Accessibility is concerned with ensuring that web content and services are equally available to people with disabilities. Specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with and contribute to the Web.

Web accessibility brings much broader benefits both to your organization and other website visitors. For example, improved code quality and structure is easier to maintain and yields better search engine rankings. Also, visitors using mobile devices with smaller screens and older people with changing abilities due to aging can benefit from accessibility accommodations.

An appreciation of how people with disabilities use the web can help you understand both the challenges faced and how simple modifications can help.
