{:.introduction}
Knowing the current state of accessibility of resources will help in understanding both the scale of the task and what activities might be necessary.

One of the first questions you are likely to face what raising accessibility with stakeholders or management is 'How much of a problem do we have?'. Part of the answer to this question is concerned with knowing what barriers and problems currently exist with organizational or project web resources.

Creating a baseline for the accessibility of your web resources will help in the short-term with securing backing and support, setting goals, and developing policies. In the long-term, a baseline will allow you to measure the impact of any changes introduced to bring about accessibility improvements.

Assessing everything in your organization may be a daunting task. To avoid this causing inertia, set a manageable scope that includes key organizational resources, such as the main organizational website. This will provide a rough indication of the scale of any problem, and, because these are the key organizational resources, they will help focusing attention.
